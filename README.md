# LanguageX
CS690 Master Project of Joe, Yolanda and Shuai

1. Statically typed, although not necessarily explicitly typed.
2. Translated to other language source (like C) or LLVM IR.
3.Could be run on a virtual machine (thus has its own bytecode)
4. Source-to-source translation and interpreter version support garbage collection. (GC for LLVM-based version is to be determined.)
5. Has pure-functional traits, like built-in immutable data structures and vector operations (that run on GPUs).
6. Support for bridge to other languages like (JAVA, Python).
