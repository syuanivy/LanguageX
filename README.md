# LanguageX
CS690 Master Project of Joe, Yolanda and Shuai

##Statically typed, although not necessarily explicitly typed.
##Translated to other language source (like C) or LLVM IR.
##Could be run on a virtual machine (thus has its own bytecode)
##Source-to-source translation and interpreter version support garbage collection. (GC for LLVM-based version is to be ##determined.)
##Has pure-functional traits, like built-in immutable data structures and vector operations (that run on GPUs).
##Support for bridge to other languages like (JAVA, Python).
